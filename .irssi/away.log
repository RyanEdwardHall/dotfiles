13:11 <2/derjurg> eop #b33r_time trunkbot 
14:31 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: and chain rule
14:38 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: apply the product rule first, and when calculating the derivative of exp(bx) or whatever it was, you'll have to use the chain rule
14:50 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: let's call ax g(x) and exp(bx) h(x), what does the product rule say about d/dx (gh)?
14:55 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: what is the product rule? Do you remember?
14:59 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: let's give bx a name now, call it u(x).  Then dh/dx = dh/du * du/dx
14:59 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: that's what the chain rule says
14:59 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: now your task is to calculate dh/du and du/dx
14:59 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: where h(x) = exp(bx)
15:01 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: right
15:03 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: that's just h'(x), if you're more familiar with that notation
15:03 ##math: < >/chessguy>/> ederjur: closer by how much (with respect to the time you've spent)?
15:03 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: derivative of h with respect to x
15:07 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: or do you not understand the right hand side? dh/du * du/dx?
15:08 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: yes that's right
15:08 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: du/dx = b as you've just established, now what is dh/du?
15:14 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: consider h as a function of u, then h = exp(u)
15:18 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: let's not jump the gun, what do you find h to be?
15:21 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: I think you're confused
15:25 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: h(u) = exp(u), what is dh/du?
15:25 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: ah, ok... no problem
15:26 ##math: < >/claymore>/> ederjur: the answer is a lot easier than you're making it
